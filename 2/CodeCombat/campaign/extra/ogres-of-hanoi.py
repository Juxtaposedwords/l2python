self.say("Let's move some ogres!")

# Your goal for this level is to move the Ogre legion from the 
# 2nd room into the 3rd in the same order. Notice you have 3 
# rooms: let's call them 1, 2, and 3. You can only move the *top* ogre 
# from a certain room at any time. To do this use the following command:

# self.say("<anything>", [2, 3])
# This moves the top ogre from room 2 to room 3.

# Keep in mind one crucial rule: there can never be a bigger
# ogre on top of a small one, or all hell shall break loose!
# Hint: use the 3rd room to avoid self.

# Hint: use recursive functions. Example:
# ints = []
# def count(n):
#    n = n - 1
#    ints = ints.append(n)
#    if n > 0:
#       count(n)
# 
# count(5)
